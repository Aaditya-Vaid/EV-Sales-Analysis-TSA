# EV-Sales-Analysis-TSA
This is my first Analytics project, so I think some of the things I did are not upto the level. By doing this project I get to know how to work with SARIMA models, and I hope to use the knowledge from this project in my future projects. 

I collected the data from https://vahan.parivahan.gov.in/vahan4dashboard/vahan/view/reportview.xhtml and used SARIMA architecture to train a model which forecasts the number of registrations of EV in India in year 2023. 

Used Seasonal-Trend Decomposition using LOESS (STL) method to break the original series into its trend, seasonal and residual components. 
It gives the seasonality and any anomaly in the original series. In this case anomaly is the time period of COVID-19 during which no or very few registration were made.

As the analysis goes by we can also see that the major sales growth in EV occured just after the COVID-19 period.
